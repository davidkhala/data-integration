# Connect to on-premises data center 
## Network: Customer-premises equipment (CPE)
This component is the on-premises endpoint for the VPN Connect or FastConnect interconnection between the on-premises data center and the virtual cloud network (VCN) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
## Extraction
Your administrators can use **Oracle SQL Developer**, **SQL*Loader**, or **Oracle Analytics Cloud Data Sync** to extract the data stored in Teradata, transform it, and upload it to Object Storage in the cloud.

**Oracle Data Integrator** is another tool that you can use, either on-premises or in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using a marketplace image. Consider using this tool if you want to support **ongoing data migration**.
